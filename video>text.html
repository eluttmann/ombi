  <h2>How Video Replaced Reviews</h2>
</div>
<br>
<div class="manifesto-content">
  <h4>It's 2021,</h4>
  <p>
    The supercomputer in your pocket has an unbelievable camera and visual display, yet we are still reading <span style="color: #C34848">text</span>, reviews and ratings to choose local places & experiences.
    <br><br>
    Text-based content is biased, secondhand and in-direct as language is inefficient to communicate experiential information. When you read someone else’s description of a place, you only create an abstraction of what the experience is really like. This can leave us compromising on the places & experiences we choose.
    <br><br>
    Sure, the existing tools do have photos slapped on top of reviews & ratings ... but they are essentially all following the same “business directory template” format: info that is organized as digital yellow pages with a few more data points slipped in. It's reminiscent of the blogging era from when these tools were created, almost 20 years ago. Meanwhile teenagers are using the 4K camera on their phones to create sensory-rich short form videos.
    <br><br>
    Existing products are also tedious to use as they are oversaturated with impersonal information. Rating information is generalized across demographics … just because the new place on Valencia is 4.5 stars, does that mean you personally will like it? A better product would curate to what you will enjoy just like Spotify playlists, Pinterest or TikTok.
    <br><br>
    Ultimately using text-based info when making decisions can lead to poor experiences and a lower quality of life.
  </p>
  <br><br><br>


  <h4>Luckily, <span style="color: #468E40">video</span> lets you see for yourself </h4>
  <p>
    Video and immersive content let you feel what a restaurant is like, rather than create an abstraction of the experience from someone else’s description. It is unbiased, firsthand and shows you the truth - so you can make clear decisions from rich information.
  <br><br>
    <b>We’re building Ombi to let people preview restaurants and experiences through video.  </b>
  </p>
  <br><br><br>


  <h4>The, <span style="color: #468E40">camera</span> is the new keyboard</h4>
  <p>We're seeing a shift to more visual, immersive content, but local places technology has not changed.
    <br><br>
    Eric recognized this shift when he was building VR models for architectural design reviews. If we can design a building in a 3D model, why are we still choosing places using reviews, ratings and text? We should be using visual content. We should be able to preview cities from our iPhone.
    <br><br>
    We’ve already seen this shift in social with the transition from Facebook to Instagram, TikTok and SnapChat. Now, visual content is becoming even more powerful with camera and reality capture technology. Apple just put a LIDAR scanner on the iPhone and is building a mixed reality headset. Facebook announced their smart glasses earlier last year.</p>
  <br><br><br>


  <h4>Preview experiences with <span style="color: #468E40">video</span></h4>
  <p>
    Ombi's rich visual moments let you feel what a restaurant experience is really like. It's like walking down Valencia street and popping into places that compel you.
    <br><br>
    The video sequence brings you through the experience from walking in the door, to the ambiance in the room, to the details of each dish. Preview experiences similar to how we preview movies.
  </p>
  <br><br><br>


  <h4>Obstacles in <span style="color: #468E40">video's </span>way</h4>
  <p>
    A challenge with video is getting great content, so who takes the videos?
    <br><br>
    Creators, micro-influencers and foodies ... who build community with their camera. Restaurant and food connoisseurs in their 20’s & 30’s are already doing this - there is an entire creator community creating short form video stories to showcase restaurants and local places.
    <br><br>
    <b>Why would they do this on Ombi?</b>
    <br><br>
    We’ve learned from the beta that creators want to share on Ombi when it helps them grow their following. Moreover, Ombi creates a focused community around the restaurant niche which allows creators to share and interact with foodies directly. This way *Experts* on Ombi can build more intimate, sustainable followings. This is in contrast to social media platforms where the creator is competing with noise on the user’s feed (friends, dance videos, dogs, etc.). The community is made of an inner ring of Experts who publish content so Viewers can preview and choose places.
  </p>
  <br><br><br>


  <h4><span style="color: #468E40">Ombi </span>is the solution we need</h4>
  <p>
    Ombi will save us from the biases and secondhand distortion of the text-based web. It's the sensory solution we need to see places for ourself and have more experience we enjoy.
    <br><br>
    We’ve seen promising results that users want to use video, rather than text / reviews. During the beta, SF restaurant-goers used the iOS app to create expectations on outdoor setups when choosing restaurants in the Mission.
    <br><br>
    Restaurants are the starting point, then next we'll let you preview other experiences such as ski trails, hotels and museums.
    <br><br>
    We want to have compelling experiences and Ombi connects us to more of these. Video and immersive content let us preview experiences directly and see for ourselves. With firsthand, high fidelity information we can make clear decisions on what we want to do and where we want to go. By making clear decisions, we can have more experiences we enjoy.
